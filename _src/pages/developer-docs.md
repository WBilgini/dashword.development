# Writer (write articles)

Dashword is looking for Geometry Dash related news, guides, and stories, specifically targetted towards new players. Most experienced players don't need a website to tell them [how to unlock The Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/), or [how to beat the Chaos Gauntlet](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-beat-chaos-gauntlet-easy/).

But new players do, and that's where Dashword comes in.

You can [apply to be a writer using this form](https://forms.gle/GE4NmbumkzNQxntu7). Here are some example articles to give you an idea of what we're looking for:

2. [New Geometry Dash 2.2 Sneak Peek: "Explorers" Analysis](/posts/geometry-dash-new-sneak-peek-analysis/)
3. [Easiest Geometry Dash User Coins: Easy Levels To Get User Coins (2022)](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-user-coins-easy/)
4. [How To Get The 2.2 Editor In Geometry Dash](/posts/how-to-get-the-2-2-editor/)

- Dashword ranks high in Google Search results for terms like "Geometry Dash" and "Geometry Dash 2.2" and is increasing every month!

# Developer (help code the website)

Dashword.net is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. If you are familiar with JavaScript, then you'll likely understand the codebase behind the website.

[Dashword is 100% open source](https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/dashword.net)! That link leads to the project's GitHub repository, where you can help out. How the website works is documented there, so I recommend reading the README if you want to contribute to the codebase. The project documentation is in the `docs/` folder. -->
